# Arduino UNO Q + Arduino App Lab Claude Skill

I used this prompt to create the skill

```
i want to create a new general skill that helps me to modify applications for Arduino UNO Q to add anything needed to be part of the Arduino App Lab ecosystem as apps but as well as bricks.

Get more information from the Arduino UNO Q here:

[https://github.com/arduino/docs-content/tree/main/content/hardware/02.uno/boards/uno-q](https://github.com/arduino/docs-content/tree/main/content/hardware/02.uno/boards/uno-q)

Get more information about the Arduino App Lab here:

[https://github.com/arduino/docs-content/tree/main/content/software/app-lab](https://github.com/arduino/docs-content/tree/main/content/software/app-lab)

Find more information here in the Edge Impulse docs on how to add your custom machine learning model in the Arduino App Lab

[https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/hardware/deployments/run-arduino-app-lab](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/hardware/deployments/run-arduino-app-lab)

Find here an example of Arduino App Lab application
